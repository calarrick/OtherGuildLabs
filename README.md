# OtherGuildLabs
Some of my Software Guild lab projects, including "DVD library" and "Address Book" web-apps

Simple MVC web apps built on the Spring framework. Make significant use of AJAX and REST endpoints and take advantage of technologies
including Spring dependency injection, Spring jdbc, Apache Maven builds, and (some) Liquibase for db schema migration/synchronization.
